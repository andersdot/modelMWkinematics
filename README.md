# modelMWkinematics

A project with David Hogg and Adrian Prince-Whelan to understand if the kinematics of the Milky Way stars are informative of their distances

In particular, we are currently trying to determine if a star is in the halo given it's proper motion and maybe some photometric information 

Trying to tie this closely to the Gaia DR2 data products, but we might need more color information
